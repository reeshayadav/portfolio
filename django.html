  <h1> Django Reflection 
  </h1>
  <h4> What about the django framework do you feel confident that you understand?
  </h4>
  <p> Django framework seemed overwhelming initially. In fact, I can't say that I understand it entirely. What I understand about Django is that it is a web framework that uses the MVC pattern. MVC refers to model view and control. Django helps in creating websites that are database driven.
  </p>
  <h4> What do you not understand about django?
  </h4>
  <p> There is a lot more that I am yet to understand about django since I worked on it for two days in the Girls Who Code summer immersion program. I ran into errors for the majority of the time. I hope with more practice I would be able to understand Django and use it more confidently.
