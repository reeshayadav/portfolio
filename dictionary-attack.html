<h3>Online Safety</h3>
<p>I personally dont put up too much information about myself online. I have a couple of social networking accounts; however, I strictly monitor who has access to my information </p>
<p>Despite my efforts to keep my family, location, personal information if someone tries hard enough then they will be able to find my information</p>
<p>A programmer can protect the privacy of their users by installing malware protection, informing the users about how to identify phishing and prompting the user to have a complicated password</p>
<p>Latanya Sweeny and Shafi Goldwasser help protect people's privacy. Sweeney develops technology to assess and solve societal problems and teaches others how to use the same technology. She is known for her work in the theory of k-anonymity to help protect people's identity. 
Goldwasser proposed the first provably-secure probabilistic public-key encryption scheme to encrypt information shared between computers in a secured way </p>
