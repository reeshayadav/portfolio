  <p>The escape bot was built to find its way out of a maze. It uses the whisker wires in the front to sense for obstacles and if the whisker wires are touched then the arduino changes its directions. The arduino changes directions based on which side was touched. It moves left if the right whisker is touched, it moves right if the left whisker is touched and finally it moves back before turning if both whiskers are touched.
  </p>
  <p>My team included Courtney, Isabelle, Larissa, Indali and me. We spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to get the whisker wires to work. While some of us were occupied with figuring out the hardware, the other half worked on the code. It was a tedious process because at times the arduino stopped working altogether and we had to share two functional arduinos among five groups. There was a lot to learn from this process and I am grateful that I had supportive people as teammates, classmates and teachers around during this process.
